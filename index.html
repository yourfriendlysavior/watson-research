    <p>Watson is a problem solving AI software created by IBM and named after their founder, Thomas J. Watson. It is a supercomupiter that processes at a rate of 80 teraflops with access to over 90 servers with a combined data score of over 200 million pages of information. Combine that with 6 million logic rules to process each choice against.</p>
<h2>Early Watson</h2>
    <p>Watson was created in 2007 by the IBM research team for the purpose of competing on the television game show, "Jeprody" It later went on to beat the two of the best Jeprody players in the world, proving to not only be able to unwind complex saements back to their question orgins, but able to do it quickly. After the Jeprody game, the IBM team took Watson and upgraded him to what he is today, and they are still ading to his capabilities. </p>

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>This signified major leaps in the technology, and proves that AI may be closer than we think. People like to compare Watson to HAL, from 2001: a Space Oddessy. </p>
    <p>Watson is now applied to much more than jeprody, and very little of is original pgramming still exists. At the moment IBM has Watson programmed with things like natural language processing, medical data, voice recgonition, sentiment analysis, busniess analytics, and more. </p>
